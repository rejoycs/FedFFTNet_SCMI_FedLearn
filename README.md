# Source Camera Model Identification via Federated Learning using Laplacian-based Patches

This repository contains implementation of various **FedFFTNet** method for Source Camera Model Identification in Federated Learning Setup. The process involves two major phases:

1. **Patching of Images**
2. **Model Training**

## 📁 Folder Structure

Ensure your dataset is pre-split into `train`, `test` folders in the following structure:

```
data/
├── train/
├── test/
```

## 🧩 Step 1: Image Patching

Laplacian based patching including distributing between global server and clients with a separated test dataset has been implemented.

**Hyperparameters**

| Variable      | Type | Default      | Description                                      |
|---------------|------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `datapath `       | str  | `./data`     | Source data directory                            |
| `number_clients`      | int  | `5`  | Number of clients                    |
| `initial_ratio`    | int  | `0.06`        | Globally available data ratio |
| `dist_type` | str | `equal` | Data distribution : `equal`, `random`, `skew` |

## 🧠 Step 2: Model Training

Once patching is complete, the resulting folder (e.g., `patches/`) should contain `initial` (if any) , `clients`, and `test` directories.
